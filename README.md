# OP-Campfires

Hi! Thanks for taking your time in reading this!

You are probably here for one of my projects so, you can use them for anything as long as you don't claim it as yours!

I am new to creating datapacks so I'd appreciate if you could tell me any errors i'm currently doing so that I can improve my work in the future!

I won't tell you what each block gives, thats for you to find out...

All you need is a campfire.
And after you have one, just "cook" one of these blocks (more to come soon!):

-Allium
-Azure bluet
-Bedrock
-Blue orchid
-Bone
-Coal
-Cobblestone
-Cooked beef
-Cooked chicken
-Cooked pork
-Crafting table
-Dandelion
-Diamond block
-Dirt
-Gunpowder

-Pink tulip
-Oak plank
-Poppy
-Red tulip
-Rotten flesh
-Oak sapling
-Seed
-Spider eye

All these items are available to have (yes including the zombie spawn egg and bedrock) all you need to do is find the right item to cook...
